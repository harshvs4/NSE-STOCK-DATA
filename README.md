# Modelling, Evaluation and Visualization



## Dataset
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthoniraj/dsr_datasets_final/main/19BDS0139.csv

The accuracy of data is only as correct as provided on the official website
(https://www.nseindia.com)

Stock used for evaluation - MARUTI

## Conclusion

Accuracy Measures are quite high
(>>>>1) and definitely not appreciable for prediction
of something as precise and detail-oriented as Stock
Data. Thus, in my opinion using Multi-Variate Linear
Regression would not be the best model for prediction,
since the model might be overfitting. Using Random
Forest might be a better option for the same.
